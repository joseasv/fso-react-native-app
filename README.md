## Repository viewer - Full Stack Open course

This repository contains the React Native app made in the exercises of the part 10 of the Full Stack Open course. The app has login/out, CSS styling mainly made 
with Flexbox rules, GraphQL queries and mutations, a top navigation bar that changes if the user is logged in and cursor based pagination. The GraphQL database used by the app can be found here https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api#-authentication.
GraphQL requests are abstracted via React hooks.
